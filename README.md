# Gen-AI-Intensive-Course-2025-Capstone-Project-Customer-Support-Agent
This project is a capstone assignment for the Generative AI Intensive Course. The focus is on building a Generative AI-powered Customer Support System using advanced techniques like prompt engineering, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and language model fine-tuning.

# 📁 Project Structure
gen-ai-intensive-course-capstone-customer-support.ipynb:
Main Jupyter notebook containing the entire workflow from data preprocessing to chatbot generation and evaluation.

## 🚀 Features
# 🧠 LLM-powered response generation
Uses pre-trained language models to generate helpful, human-like responses to customer queries.

# 📄 Contextual support using RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)
Combines the power of LLMs with a document retrieval system to ground answers in real data.

# 🧪 Prompt engineering
Designed and tested prompt templates to optimize output relevance and tone.

# 📊 Evaluation
Evaluates response quality using metrics like coherence, factual accuracy, and helpfulness.

# 🛠️ Requirements
Python 3.8+

Jupyter Notebook

Transformers (HuggingFace)

LangChain / Haystack (if used for retrieval)

FAISS / ChromaDB (if vector store is used)

SentenceTransformers

OpenAI API / HuggingFace Hub API (optional)

To install required packages:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
(Create requirements.txt from the notebook using !pip freeze > requirements.txt if needed.)

# 📚 Use Case
This capstone simulates a real-world customer support scenario, such as assisting users of a product or service. It is aimed at:

Improving automated response systems

Reducing human agent load

Providing faster support turnaround

# 🧩 Example Queries
"I forgot my password—how do I reset it?"

"Where can I track my order?"

"Is there a refund policy for digital downloads?"
